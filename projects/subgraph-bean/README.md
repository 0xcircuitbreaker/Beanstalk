# Bean Subgraph

The Bean subgraph can be found here:
https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=0x925753106fcdb6d2f30c3db295328a0a1c5fd1d1-1

When using graph cli commands, you will often need to specify which manifest file should be used. This is necessary to support multiple chains in the same codebase. The commands which need it will be evident - as they will fail when unable to find a `subgraph.yaml` file. In those commands, include `./manifest/${chain}.yaml` as the final argument to the command. See scripts inside `package.json` for examples.
